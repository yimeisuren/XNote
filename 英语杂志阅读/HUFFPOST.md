BAKHMUT, Ukraine (AP) — <u>Russian forces[^5]</u> <u>pounded[^6]</u> an eastern <u>Ukrainian[^7]</u> city Thursday and the two sides <u>waged[^8]</u> <u>pitched street battles[^9]</u> that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said could [determine the fate of the critical Donbas **region**[^10].](https://apnews.com/hub/russia-ukraine)

<u>In the wake of[^15]</u> a series of <u>setbacks[^16]</u> in the 3-month-old war, Russia <u>set its sights on[^17]</u> the industrial Donbas region of coal mines and factories, where <u>Moscow-backed separatists[^18]</u> have been fighting Ukrainian <u>troops[^19]</u> for years and where they already held <u>swaths of territory[^20]</u> before the <u>invasion[^21]</u>.

But, as elsewhere, the Russian <u>advance[^24]</u> has not been <u>as quick as expected[^25]</u>, and the plodding battle for control of Sievierodonetsk has devolved into street-to-street fighting that has been relatively rare in the conflict.

“Fierce battles continue in the city itself, street battles are <u>taking place[^26]</u> with varied success in city blocks,” Luhansk governor Serhiy Haidai told The Associated Press. “The army of Ukraine is fighting for every street and house.”

<u>Separately[^27]</u> Thursday, Russia’s <u>Defense Ministry[^28]</u> said it used <u>air-launched missiles[^29]</u> against a Ukrainian <u>military[^30]</u> <u>base in[^31]</u> the Zhytomyr region, to the west of Kyiv, <u>alleging[^32]</u> that <u>mercenaries[^33]</u> were being trained there.

There was no immediate comment from Ukrainian <u>authorities[^34]</u> to the Russian claims. Moscow has repeatedly accused Ukraine of using mercenaries in the fighting. Foreigners have fought <u>as part of[^35]</u> Ukraine’s <u>regular military[^36]</u> and some have joined volunteer <u>brigades[^37]</u>, but it’s <u>unclear[^38]</u> whether they’re mercenaries.

Zhytomyr has <u>periodically[^39]</u> suffered missile strikes — but the <u>vast majority[^40]</u> of fighting and attacks have been <u>concentrated in[^41]</u> Ukraine’s east.

<u>Late Wednesday[^42]</u>, Zelenskyy called the <u>painstaking[^43]</u>, inch-by-inch fight for Sievierodonetsk the “<u>epicenter[^44]</u>” of the battle for the Donbas and perhaps one of the most difficult battles of the war. The city is <u>one of the last[^45]</u> yet to be <u>taken by[^46]</u> the Russians in Luhansk, one of the two regions that <u>make up[^47]</u> the Donbas.

“In many ways, it is there that the fate of our Donbas is being decided,” Zelenskyy said in his <u>nightly[^48]</u> video address, which was recorded in the street <u>outside his office[^49]</u> in <u>Kyiv[^50]</u>.

Oleksiy Arestovych, an <u>adviser[^51]</u> to Zelenskyy’s office, said Tuesday that Russian forces have changed their <u>tactics[^52]</u> in the battle, <u>retreating from[^53]</u> Sievierodonetsk, while pounding it with <u>artillery and airstrikes[^54]</u> — without any particular success.

They are also <u>targeting[^55]</u> the neighboring city of Lysychansk with “day and night shelling,” as well as trying to <u>storm[^56]</u> the <u>key road[^57]</u> connecting Lysychansk and Bakhmut to the southwest, he said.
