## Schools need research to guide the recovery from COVID disruption

> Evidence <u>from around the world</u>[^1] can help children to <u>catch up</u>[^2], and could improve education <u>as a whole</u>[^3].

One of the most shocking impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic <u>has nothing to do</u>[^4] with infections or health. It is that school <u>closures</u>[^5] have damaged the education of <u>some</u>[^6] 1.6 billion children around the world.

<u>Two years into the pandemic</u>[^7], schools had been completely closed for <u>an average of</u>[^8] more than 4.5 months across countries. <u>One in ten</u>[^9] countries had closed schools for more than nine months, according to the United Nations cultural organization (UNESCO), and millions of children around the world had not <u>gone back</u>[^10] at all. Data are still <u>coming in</u>[^11], but they are starting to confirm what everyone feared: that the children facing the biggest setbacks in learning are those who are poor <u>or otherwise</u>[^12] <u>disadvantaged</u>[^13]. And <u>it is well established that</u>[^14] learning losses leave <u>lifelong scars</u>[^15], so it is likely that this will lead to lost opportunities and lower incomes for <u>decades to come</u>[^16].

Many nations want to <u>minimize</u>[^17] these losses, but <u>returning schools to business</u>[^18] as usual would be a mistake. Instead, they should use this moment to improve teaching and education systems, <u>informed by research</u>[^20]. As a [Feature published today](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-01387-7) makes clear, researchers have built up large bodies of evidence, including randomized controlled trials, that point to cost-effective methods of improving school attendance and learning in both low-income and high-income countries. These strategies range from providing information to parents and children about the long-term benefits of education, to helping children comprehend what they read, <u>involving parents in children’s education</u>[^19], giving children meaningful feedback on their work and helping students to plan and evaluate their own learning.

Too often, such research is overlooked by educators and ignored by policymakers who mistakenly think they know what works best. But putting evidence-based insights to work in classrooms around the world would help children to recover from the educational damage inflicted by the pandemic. It would also strengthen entire education systems, many of which were failing children well before COVID-19 struck. Many children are denied education by conflict, poverty or politics, including crises such as the war in Ukraine and the Taliban’s decision to exclude many girls from school in Afghanistan.
